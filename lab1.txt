1)whoami
2)cd /
  cd tmp
  touch testingFile
3)file testingFile
4)rmdir can only be used to remove an empty directory. It won't work for non-empty directories.

rm removes both files and non-empty directories.

For example, you create a directory called test with the command mkdir test.

You don't create any files in that directory and, later on, you decide to remove it. If so, you can legitimately use rmdir test.

Should you have created files inside the test directory, you'd have to enter rm -r test/ to remove both the test directory and its files.

An even faster solution is rm -rf, which removes recursively and forcefully all files in a directory and the directory itself.
5)cd ../home/
6)touch tryit&
  mv tryit tryit_now
7)alias myclear="clear"
8) a)	clear is renamed to cls now cls clears the screen
	ls is renamed to cls now cls list the files in directories
   b)   d1 directory is created, now change directory,two files f1 and f2 are created in d1, then f1 is modified, using cd without parameters take to home directory and again making directory name d1 gives error message

Question2
1)mkdir -p tmp/BSEF15516/amber/OS
2)ls -la
3)rm -r BSEF15M5516
  rmdir -p BSEF15M5516/amber/OS
  ls
4)touch tmp/testFile
  cat -n testFile
5)mv testFile test@File
  File still exists
6)tail -n 2 testFile
7)alias unleash="ls -la"
8)man command name example
 man ls
9)type type
10)rm -r (directory name)

1)sudo mkdir -p dilawer/reports
  ls

2)sudo mkdir -p /home/abdul

3)cd ..
  cd ..
  cd abdul
  pwd
  sudo touch file1
  ls
4)cd ..

  sudo mkdir staff
  ls
  cd staff
  ls
  sudo mkdir arif rauf
  ls
5)pwd
